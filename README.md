# PyTeach 

Similar to Leetcode, a local solution to develop your python skills.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylandibeneditto/pyteach ; cd pyteach
```

### Creating a Challenge

```bash
python tutor/tutor.py
```

Open your editor to the `challenge.py` file in the new `pyteach` folder.
Now you can code out the challenge in the `challenge.py` file.

> The runner calls the function in the `challenge.py` file, so there's no need to create a main function

### Testing your `challenge.py`

```bash
python run.py
```
